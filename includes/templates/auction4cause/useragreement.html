	    c. Prior to participating in an Auction, Users must register with                the Company and setup a Member profile in which they will choose                a charity, from a list of charities determined by the Company. For                every Bid the Participant places in an Auction, the charity in the                Participant's Member profile will receive one point. Participants                may alter their charity selection by editing their Member profile.                Participants will also have the option to submit information about                their favorite &quot;unlisted&quot; charity. The Company will select                two (2) member submitted charities every quarter to receive a portion                of the donations as described herein this Users Agreement. The remaining                proceeds will be distributed to the listed charities based on the                percentage of points they receive as described herein this Users                Agreement.<br />
	    d. Before each Auction, the Company will determine the maximum Bid                amount for each Auction and the Maximum Number of Bids that will                be accepted for the Auction. This price will be displayed for each                Auction and is referred to as the &quot;Get4&quot; price. <br />
	    e. Participants in the Auction will submit Bids less than or equal                to the &quot;Get4&quot; price in United States Dollars and cents                and will pay a administration and registration fee (Hereinafter:                &quot;Bidding Fees&quot;) for each submitted Bid. <br />

	    g. Each Auction will close when it meets the closing requirements                as described herein this Users Agreement. After the Auction closes,                the Participant that submitted the winning (successful) Bid is determined.                The Successful Bid is the highest unique Bid for the offered item                out of all Bids received for the Auction. A unique Bid is a Bid                that is not identical to any other Bid submitted in that Auction. <br />

	    i. After receiving payment for the Successful Bid from the Successful                Participant, the Company will ship or deliver the product and/or                service via methods described herein this Users Agreement to the                address contained in the Successful Participants Member profile                at the time the Bid was submitted and accepted by the Company.</p>

Bidding Fees are charged to the                Participant for each Bid placed by them, at the time the Bid is                placed, in a Unique Auction, whether their Bid was successful or                not. The company may charge different Bidding Fees for separate                Auctions from time to time, according to the company's discretion<br />
	    d. &quot;Blind Bid&quot; is a Bid for an Active Auction in which                the Participant does not have knowledge of any Bids placed by other                Participants in the Auction.<br />

	    f. &quot;Bonus Auction Credit&quot; is a credit earned by a Member                that allows them to participate in a Bonus Auction. Bonus Auction                Credits are distributed by the Company at its sole discretion as                set forth in this Users Agreement.<br />

(For example: If Participant &quot;A&quot; Bids $69.48                in a Unique Auction and Participant &quot;B&quot; subsequently submits                the identical Bid of $69.48 in the same Unique Auction, the Bids                will be classified as Duplicate Bids and will be excluded from being                selected as the Successful Bid.)<br />
	    j. &quot;Free Auctions&quot; are Auctions in which a Participant                uses a Free Auction Credit to participate rather than paying Bidding                Fees. In order to participate in a Free Auction a Participant must                have a Free Auction Credit.<br />

	    o. The &quot;Maximum Number of Bids&quot; is the greatest number                of Bids that can be submitted for each Unique Auction.

The Minimum Number of Bids to close an Auction will                always be equal to or lower than the Maximum Number of Bids for                each Unique Auction. The Company reserves the right to change the                Minimum Number of Bids to close an Auction at any time. <br />

	    w. &quot;Successive Auction&quot; is a new Auction that is automatically                opened, with the identical properties as the original Auction, when                Participants are in the process of Bidding in the original Auction                and the original Auction has subsequently received the Maximum Number                of Bids during this time. It is offered immediately upon the preceding                Auction closing and allows Participants in the process of Bidding                on an Auction to participate in an identical Auction for the same                product and/or service.<br />
	    x. &quot;Suggested Retail Price&quot; or &quot;SRP&quot; is the                price supplied to the Company by our partners and/or distributors.                The SRP is typically equal to the Manufacturers Suggested Retail                Price (MSRP) for a particular product and/or service, though the                Company does not warrant that the SRP will always be equal to the                MSRP.<br />
	    y. &quot;Unique Auction&quot; or &quot;Auction&quot; is an Auction                4 Charity as set forth in this Users Agreement and has a unique                code to identify it.<br />
	    z. &quot;Auditor&quot; the accounting offices shall audit the Auctions                and other transactions as described herein.</p>
	  <p>4. Auction Process</p>
	  <p>a. The Company will determine for each Unique                Auction, amongst other things, the following minimum details:<br />
	    i. The product and/or service being offered in each Unique Auction;<br />
	    ii. the unique code defining each Unique Auction;<br />
	    iii. the &quot;Get4&quot; price for each Unique Auction;<br />
	    iv. the Bidding Fees required to participate in each Unique Auction;<br />
	    v. the Maximum Number of Bids per Unique Auction;<br />
	    vi. the Minimum Number of Bids required before the Auction can close;<br />
	    vii. the &quot;SRP&quot; of the product and/or service being offered.                The company is not responsible for any variances between the SRP                and published MSRP for a particular product and/or service offered                in an Auction;<br />
	    viii. whether the Auction is a Successive Auction as defined in                this Users Agreement;<br />
	    b. Participants may place Bids and will be charged Bidding Fees                for every Bid submitted until the requirements to close an Auction                have been meet. When an Auction closes the Successful Bidder will                be determined.<br />
	    c. Once an Auction closes, the Successful Bidder is given the right                to purchase the product and/or service at the price defined by their                Successful Bid. The Company will pay all taxes and shipping expenses,                unless otherwise stated in the Auction's details. If a Participant                fails to pay the Successful Bid amount, as defined in this Users                Agreement, they will forfeit the right to purchase the product and/or                service.<br />
	    d. Participants have the right to cancel their purchase of a product                and/or service if their Bid is chosen as the Successful Bid. If                a Participant chooses to cancel their right to purchase a product                and/or service they may request, in writing, for a refund for the                Bidding Fees for their Successful Bid. Other Bidding Fees will not                be refunded. The company reserves the right to re-offer cancelled                or forfeited products and/or services in a new Unique Auction or                donate them to a charity selected by the Company at its sole discretion.<br />
	    e. For every Bid placed in an Auction, the charity selected in the                Members profile will receive one point. Points are used to determine                the distribution ratios of the net Auction proceeds, for all Closed                Auctions, to be donated to each charity. Donations to the charities                selected by the Company will at least 25% of the net Auction proceeds                and will be distributed by the Company quarterly. <br />
	    f. The Company attempts to set the &quot;Get4&quot; price for each                Unique Auction to between 10% and 20% of the SRP for that product                and/or service. Though very unlikely, if it becomes possible to                purchase, through other means, the identical product and/or service                at a price that's less than the &quot;Get4&quot; price, the Company                will not be held responsible. </p>
