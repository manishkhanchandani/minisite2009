<p>I need a clone, or a script rather that works EXACTLY like http://www.auctions4acause.com. This is a simple auction script where people pay per bid (paypal, and maybe one other service), and can not see the other bids (but i can in the admin area). The object is to be the bidder with the highest unique bid, then they can buy the item for a very cheap price. Spending a good 20 minutes or so at the site will show you what I mean. I do request the admin function be extensive, I need to be able to post auctions, manage users, have all IPs logged, send emails to all users, etc. I HAVE TO HAVE the charity aspect of the site as well. I DO NOT need web design but there should be a template system in place. Please do not post if you cant do this for a reasonable price, as well as within a good time frame. Please dont waste my time. If the script is pre-made, it needs to be altered to do what I'm asking for and I expect a lower price for an altered pre-made script. Otherwise, the budget I'm posting is for something entirely custom. A demo is required. :) Thanks! I want this fast, well programmed and I'm ready to pay(CC in hand). I've always bought pre-made mass produced scripts and I'm sick of it. It is worth it to pay a programmer and get what you really want to be successful.Additional Info (Added 4/9/2009 at 11:17 EST)...</p>
<p>I don't care if the script is custom or an altered pre-made script as long as it does what I need it to do. And the budget is still $200 for either product. <br />

<p>ok, would you be able to do what's listed below.... I would much rather go with you because of your good reviews and quick turnaround time. I went through the auctions for a cause site thoroughly and wrote down all of its features I could see or anticipate how it would work in the admin section:</p>
<p>These are the basic features for the auctions4acause clone script I would like. No need for site design, I can do that:<br />
</p>
<p>User:<br />
  <strong>- User account</strong><br />
  - Bid History<br />
  <strong>- Profile update page</strong><br />
  - Billing &amp; Shipping update page<br />
  <strong>- Friend referral page</strong><br />
  - Social networking block so they can spread the word</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin:<br />
  <strong>- Ability to set a bidding fee. Like I'd like to make it so they can bid as many times as they want but they have to pay a set amount per bid.</strong><br />
  <strong>- Ability to let them choose which charity they would like to send a portion of their bid fee too.</strong><br />
  <strong>- Ability to set the maximum bid price per bid.</strong><br />
  - The highest unique (unduplicated) bid wins<br />
  - Ability to set the maximum number of bids each item must have before the auction is won. If the max number of bids is reached, the auction ends. Otherwise,</p>
<p>I should be able to set a date for the auction to end even if the max number of bids is not reached.<br />
  <strong>- Ability to turn the charity feature on and off</strong><br />
  <strong>- The Ability to add what charities I like</strong><br />

  - Ability for users to earn 1 loyalty credit for each paid bid<br />
  <strong>- Ability to create bonus auctions</strong><br />
  - Ability to make bonus auctions free to bid on<br />
  - The loyalty credits can only work for the bonus auctions<br />

  <strong>- The ability to have as many auctions as I want to be active</strong><br />

  <strong>- The ability to have categories for the auctions</strong><br />
  - Admin accounting page that totals the bid/sales by item and total and that tallies all of the contributions for each charity so I know how much to send to</p>
<p>each charity<br />
  - Admin ability to check regularly on the number of bids already made per item<br />
  - Ability to refund bids<br />
  - automatically notify users when new auctions are listed<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well I'm not sure what you need but...</p>
<p>https://developer.paypal.com/<br />
  https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=developer/howto_api_reference</p>
<p>Actually just do the Paypal gateway. I'll have someone else do the others. I'm not a programmer and honestly don't know what I should be getting for you. Other programmers I've know had their own resources for setting up gateways. I'll still of course pay $200 for you to do the script.</p>
<p>I'm also going to pass on wholesale integration. I see they have a new batch upload feature and that will be fine. So if you could make an export based on their batch import, that would be great. I will send you a batch upload sample from them so you know what the output should be.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
