        <p>Information Collection and Use<br />
          </p>
        <p>Information Collection<br />
          Auctions 4 a Cause is the sole owner of the information collected                on www.auctions4acause.com. Auctions 4 a Cause collects information                from our users at several different points on our Web site.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Registration<br />
          In order to use most of this Web site, a user must first complete                the registration form. During registration a user is required to                give contact information (such as name and email address). <br />
          </p>
        <p>Order<br />
          We request information from the user on our order form. A user must                provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address)                and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration                date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill                customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information                is used to contact the user.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Information Use<br />
          Auctions 4 a Cause will use your information to process your bids                and notify you when you are the winning bidder. We will also display                your first name, last initial, city and state on our auctions winners                list. We will pass the information needed to our third party credit                card processor and our shipping companies only. <br />
          </p>
        <p>We might use aggregate (non-personally identifiable)                information to share with select parties such as the participating                charities. We will not rent/sell/share your personal information.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Cookies<br />
          A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to                information about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent                cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser,                the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text                file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time.                Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser                help file directions, but this will remove any automated login information                you might have set. See http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm                for more information about cookies.<br />
          </p>
        <p>By setting a persistent cookie on our site, users                would not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby                saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they                may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user                will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, you will                not be able to place a bid, unless you accept session (temporary                cookies) <br />
          </p>
        <p>Log Files<br />
          Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes                internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service                provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,                and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track                user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information                for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally                identifiable information. <br />
          </p>
        <p>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br />
          We do not employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.                Web Beacons/Web Bugs), but we do use clear gifs in our HTML-based                emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.                This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications                and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If users would                like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. <br />
          </p>
        <p>Communications from the Site</p>
        <p>Special Offers and Updates<br />
          We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and                username. Established members will occasionally receive information                on products, services and special deals. Out of respect for the                privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these                types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. <br />
          </p>
        <p>Service Announcements<br />
          On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service                related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily                suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally,                users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate                their account. However, these communications are not promotional                in nature. <br />
          </p>
        <p>Customer Service<br />
          We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested                services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply                via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Sharing</p>
        <p>Legal Disclaimer<br />
          Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need                to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we                have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply                with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process                served on our Web site.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)<br />
          We might share aggregated demographic information with our partners.                This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Third Party Advertisers<br />
          Auctions 4 a Cause does NOT share Web site usage information about                users with third party advertisers.<br />
          </p>
        <p>These are the instances in which we will share                users' personal information:<br />
          We only Share Personal Information with Third Parties in order to                process your bid and order.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Third Party Intermediaries<br />
          We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit                card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These                companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable                information for any secondary purposes.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Business Transitions<br />
          In the event Auctions 4 a Cause goes through a business transition,                such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling                a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most                instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified                via email and prior to a change of ownership or control of their                personal information. If as a result of the business transition,                the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a                manner different from that stated at the time of collection they                will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes                section.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Choice/Opt-out<br />
          Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their                information used for purposes not directly related to our site at                the point where we ask for information. For example, our registration                form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who register with us, but                don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address                off of our lists. <br />
          Users who no longer wish to receive our marketing communications                may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe                or email us at info@auctions4acause.com. We also offer an opt-out                mechanism on the member profile pages.<br />

        <p>Security<br />
          This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.                When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their                information is protected both online and off-line.<br />
          When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such                as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected                with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. </p>
        <p>While on a secure page, such as our order form,                the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator                and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,                or open, when users are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL,                follow this link http://www.verisign.com/ . <br />
          </p>
        <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive                information online, we also do everything in our power to protect                user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just                the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our                offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific                job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative)                are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees                are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every                quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees                are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,                and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected.                Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information                are in a secure environment, in a locked facility. <br />
          </p>
        <p>If users have any questions about the security                at our Web site, users can send an email to info@auctions4acause.com.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Address Verification<br />
          We use VeriSign to verify a user's identity to authorize a credit                card transaction.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal                Information<br />
          If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as                zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer                desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate                users' personally identifiable information. This can usually be                done at the member profile page or by emailing our Customer Support                at info@auctions4acause.com. Or, contact us by postal mail at the                contact information listed below.<br />
          </p>
        <p>Notification of Changes <br />
          If we are going to use users' personally identifiable information                in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection                we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether                or not we use their information in this different manner. However,                if users have deleted/deactivated their account, then they will                not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in                this new manner. <br />
